# Fraud-Detection-Motor-Vehicle-Claims
This project aims to detect vehicular insurance fraud claims using machine learning. Vehicular insurance fraud refers to the deliberate submission of false, exaggerated, or misleading
information in insurance claims for motor vehicle accidents or damages. Such fraud can take various forms,
such as touting, staged accidents or falsified claims. In recent years, Singapore has seen a surge of such
cases, with motor insurance fraud tripling from 2018 to 2020. The General Insurance Association of
Singapore estimates that at least 20% of all motor insurance claims are exaggerated, resulting in almost
$100 million in losses. With a rise in motor insurance fraud, it is imperative for insurers to develop
systematic fraud detection strategies using data generated from historical claims. To combat vehicle
insurance fraud effectively, we propose the development of a machine learning model that aims to predict
vehicular insurance fraud based on claims data submitted by policyholders. Recognizing that labelling data
is a costly affair, our development process considers the use of unsupervised, supervised, and semisupervised
models to achieve the best performance according to the different levels of labelling costs
insurers are willing and able to bear.
